%ARRAYSHTFILTERSTHEORY_RADINVERSE2D Generate SHT filters based on theoretical
%responses (regularized radial inversion)
%
%   Generate the filters to convert microphone signals from a spherical
%   microphone array to SH signals, based on an ideal theoretical model of 
%   the array. The filters are generated from an inversion of the radial 
%   components of the response, neglecting spatial aliasing effects and
%   non-ideal arrangements of the microphones. One filter is shared by all
%   SH signals of the same order in this case.
%   Here this single channel inversion problem is done with a constraint on
%   max allowed amplification regularization, using Tikhonov
%   regularization, similar e.g. to 
%
%       Moreau, S., Daniel, J., Bertet, S., 2006, 
%       3D sound field recording with higher order ambisonics-objective 
%       measurements and validation of spherical microphone. 
%       In Audio Engineering Society Convention 120.
%
%   Inputs:
%       R:          radius of spherical array
%       Nmic:       number of microphones on the sphere
%       order_sht:  order of SH signals to generate
%       Lfilt:      number of FFT points for the output filters
%       fs:         sample rate for the output filters
%       amp_threshold:      max allowed amplification for filters, in dB
%
%   Outputs:
%       H_filt: nSH x nMics x (Lfilt/2+1) returned filters in the frequency 
%           domain (half spectrum up to Nyquist)
%       h_filt: Lfilt x order_sht+1 impulse responses of the above filters

## Triton

The [Triton/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/Triton/) folder contains bash scripts that were used to start Matlab in Aalto University's high-performance computing cluster, [Triton](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/).

## Analysis

The [analysis/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/analysis/) folder contains scripts to analyse the data.

## Code from Akis

The [code_from_akis/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/code_from_akis/) folder contains functions and scripts, that are developed by [Politis](https://github.com/polarch), and that were provided to the author directly.

## Encoding

The [encoding/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/encoding/) folder contains functions that can be used to encode plane waves into the Ambisonic domain with two different ideal virtual spherical microphone arrays: Eigenmike [1] and the Mixed-order array developed in DTU [2].

## Save fields

The [save_fields/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/save_fields/) folder contains functions, that can be called to calculate and save pressure/velocity responses into some output file.

## Support functions

The [support_functions/](https://github.com/mapu8/Spherical-scatterer-effects/tree/master/src/support_functions/) folder contains functions, that are used to calculate the pressure/velocity fields around a scatterer. It also contains various other functions, that are used throughout the code base.
